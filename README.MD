TFC-Tweaks
==========

Read before using
-----------------

The version of TFC this is compiled against can be found in the [lib_jars](lib_jars) folder.

When using any other version, you are on your own. If the version of TFC does not exist yet, its a custom build. (I'll try to avoid that though) 

This mod alters some of the mechanics of TFC to the point where you could say it changes game balance, but those features are disabled by default.

Download
--------

Download the normal (not -dev or -src) jar from [here](https://jenkins.dries007.net/job/TFC-Tweaks/lastSuccessfulBuild/).

Features
--------

- OreDictionary armor dye recipe (always on)
- Fuel on firepit despawn prevention (off by default, despawn time configurable)
- Combine foods on pickup (off by default)
